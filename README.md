# CountryInformationApp
A short exercise I had to do for the NYCDA full stack development course.


//Country Information Exercise 
//Part 1
//Create a Node.js application that does the following:
//- Takes in one parameter from the command line, the name of a country. Note: command line arguments can be read from the global array `process.argv`
//- Reads and parses the `countries.json` file. Note: you must use readFile and not readFileSync. Get it here: countries.jsonVoorbeeld van documentIn een nieuw venster weergeven
//- Outputs information about that specific country. Must be in the following format:
//Country: <country name>
//Top Level Domain: <tld>
